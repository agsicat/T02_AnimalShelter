# T02_AnimalShelter - AnimalBase Android App
# Create by Nicholas Brons, Angela Grace Sicat, Maria Mamaclay

This is a prototype Android application for our Human Computer Interactions course. 

It functions as a backend system application for an animal shelter use to track their animals.
Currently uses dummy data to simulate the capabilities of the mobile app.

The main goal for AnimalBase, is to provide animal shelters with a user-friendly tool to track and keep records of animals at 
their shelter.  AnimalBase is an information management tool that utilizes a database structure for capturing a vast amount of 
data that is recorded for each animal. As part of our investigate phase, we built a better understanding of what tools or practices 
is currently used at animal shelters. Moving forward, we were able to develop an app that meet these needs.
